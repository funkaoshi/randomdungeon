randomdungeon
=============

A term I hadn't heard before discovering [the RPG scene on Google+][1] was "Gygaxian Democracy".
People will crowd source material for D&D games from the masses, often with much success.
[Zak Smith][zak] seems to be the best at getting people out for these sorts of activities.
Most recently, [he crowd sourced dungeon room descriptions][2]. His rules were simple: 8 words 
or less, don't try too hard to be clever. That's apparently all you need to end up with lots 
and lots of dungeon.

As I am known to do, [I turned the whole exercise into a website][3]. It keys random dungeons.
Enjoy. This is the repository for the code that makes that all go.
